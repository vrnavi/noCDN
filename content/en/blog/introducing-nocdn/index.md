This site was made to solve two problems:

- The fact that files hosted on services like Discord are hard to get to without sacrificing some privacy.
- The fact that these files can be abruptly deleted at any time, for any reason, with no notice.

How this site works is simple! Links to files are submitted to GitHub Issues, which they then will be added to the site, both directly linked and linked through archive services.

To keep things safe, this site will not be hosting any copyrighted material, nor will this site endorse piracy. If a file **that you uploaded** was linked to here, feel free to reach out on GitHub Issues to take it down.
